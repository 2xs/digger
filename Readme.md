This repository contains a tool to convert Coq code written in a
“C-style” (imperative style based on a monad, with full application of
functions) into the corresponding C code or to an intermediate
representation (deep) output as Coq source code. It starts from the
Coq code extracted as JSON by the internal extraction facility.
